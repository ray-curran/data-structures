# Stacks

A stack is a special data structure where you only add, access, and remove elements from the top.  A stack is also known as a last-in first-out (LIFO) structure. The **Last** thing to be added **In** to a stack is the **First** thing that comes **Out** of it.

## Why is this important?

Stacks are everywhere. As you learned in Phase 1, your computer uses a call-stack when it executes code. You probably blew the call stack more than a few times when you studied recursion.

Stacks are simple data structures, but they're powerful too. A simple infix (e.g. 3 + 4) expression parser can be produced using nothing but stacks, queues and the [Shunting-yard algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm), and executed using a stack-based [reverse-polish notation calculator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Most importantly for us, stacks are a classic example of a last-in-first-out data structure. "LIFO" and "FIFO" are a useful part of your technical vocabulary as you reason about data and how it's processed. We'll talk more about FIFO in the Queue data structure challenge.

## Release 1: Implement the Stack

Write and test a `Stack` class that conforms to the following interface:

### Interface
- `Stack#new()`: Instantiate a new `Stack`
- `Stack#push(element)`: Add a new element to the top of the stack
- `Stack#pop`: Remove and return the top element of the stack
- `Stack#top`: Return (but do not remove) the top element of the stack
- `Stack#empty?`: Answer whether or not the stack is empty

Do not use any Ruby data structures in your implementation. Instead, pick one of your own to use in your implementation:

 * FixedArray
 * ArrayList
 * LinkedList

## Release 2: Implement an RPN calculator

Let's get a feel for how we'd use a stack. Implement a [Reverse Polish Notation Calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation). Use the [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation#Postfix_algorithm) for the postfix algorithm present on the wikipedia page.
